                              <p>My primary academic motivation has come from my positive exposure to science. During secondary and high school years, I had been strongly inspired by my academic role models and was having early chances to get started with 
                                   research. In addition to that, my experiences studying at a research-intensive institution greatly contribute to my desire to move forward with academia. Being part of a large public campus, I have gone through golden 
                                   opportunities to get involved in multiple working environments including both industrial-like jobs and research-based positions. Especially, while working as a teaching assistant in the field of computer science and a 
                                   research team member of the Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program, focusing on augmenting a teachable robot with adaptive cognitive and social support, I have recognized my fascination with computer science education. 
                                   I am also interested in theoretical computer science, from which I have been actively engaged in the integration of learning theories and cognitive psychology principles with algorithm designs to optimize self-studying approaches.</p>
                              <p>I hope to contribute my experience to make computer science more accessible to all who want to join the field.</p>

                                   members of the project in coding and computing tasks that are aligned with data analysis, machine learning, data curation, and automation of data gathering to support the project. Further tasks include developing prototypes in Python and re-implementing
